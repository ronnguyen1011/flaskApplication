            <p>
              We are searching for a motivated student software development for
              an IOS and Android development internship
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center">More About Us</h2>
            <hr class="line" />
            <p>
              The products we build have a positive impact on people's lives and
              the world around us. If you are just standing your journey in
              software development, or if you are a seasoned pro, we have a
              place for you here. Our apps are used all around the world, so you
              will have an opportunity here to learn and grow in an environment
              where millions of people every day interact with our technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our top paid CEOs don't rake in the cash at your expense, and our
              shareholders only get a dividend. This enables us to pay our
              employees with the best wages and benefits imaginable. We don't
              offer merely "competitive" wages, we pay each employee the largest
              cut of product of their labor. Also, unlike our competitors, we
              don't manipulate our users or sell their data to stay in business.
              Truly a cutting edge company, you will love working here!
            </p>
